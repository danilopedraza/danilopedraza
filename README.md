Things I like:

- Programming (duh)
- Free software
- Lifting weights
- Yapping about anything
- Drinking (everything above *feels* better with this)
- Reading

I'm currently captivated by Rust, but I'm not very picky on what I use.

That's a lie, these are my preferences:

- Strong typing > everything
- Declarative >>>>>>>>>>> Imperative
- Obsessive automation >>>> "iT doEsN't WoRtH iT"
- Copyleft >>>>>>> Permissive
