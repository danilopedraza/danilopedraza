Things I like:

- Free software
- Lifting weights
- [Electronic music](https://soundcloud.com/eternangustia/sets)
- Yapping about anything
- Reading

I'm currently captivated by Rust, but I'm not very picky on what I use.

That's a lie, these are my preferences:

- Static analysis FTW
- Declarative >>>>>>>>>>> Imperative
- Obsessive automation >>>> "iT doEsN't WoRtH iT"
- Copyleft >>>>>>> Permissive
